# Suwon Univ. 207 Lab - IoT Project

## About this repository
This repository is for the project that has been performing by 207 laboratory at Suwon University since 2015. 11.<br>
And this is supported by Hanium ICT mentoring program<br>

## What is this project?
Simply, the service of this project is to provide a solution that is associated with attendance management of the employees of any organization including any company or enterprise, school and so on<br>
With this service, the administrators can know all about attendance status of all of employees more easily<br>
Also they can show these things as visualized data<br>
Before use this service, be sure all employees have to install the Android application we made and of course, never remove that application<br>
The application detect where the user in and automatically send a commute information to server when the user is in or out of the specific places<br> 
To detect where is the specific place at Android application, each "specific" place must has 3 BLE beacons,<br>
and these beacons must be registered into the database that is used by this Node.js server<br>

### Github repository of be mentioned Android application
This application has been developing by Lee Yutaek<br>
[GitHub](https://github.com/eldbxor/CommutingChecker)<br>

## Requirement and Environment
### Needed pre-known languages and background of be using frameworks in this project to development
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Skills of writing SQLs for MySQL or MariaDB
* Node.js and npm

### Used npm packages
* express.js
* node-mysql
* node-rsa
* node-schedule
* node-time
* async
* winston

### Framework to provide responsive website
* AdminLTE

### Framework to communicate between Node.js and Android devices
* socket.io

## How to execute this Node.js server
Clone this repository and execute it as debugging mod<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesometic/207lab_iot_project.git
sudo DEBUG=app:* npm start
```
For now, all used npm packages are involved in this repository<br>
So you don't have to install dependency npm packages specified in package.json file<br>

## Essential pre-installed database structure
You have to make database and tables into your DBMS to use this Node.js server properly<br>
```javascript
var pool = mysql.createPool({
    connectionLimit : 100,
    host            : 'localhost',
    user            : '207lab',
    password        : '207lab',
    database        : 'project_CM'
});
```
As you see above code, you should make database named "project_CM",<br>
and add a user named '207lab' into your DBMS, give password '207lab' on it<br>
Or, you can just modify the code as you want<br>
Be sure you granted to "the user" to access "the project" through localhost<br>
This service requires database tables that is figured below<br>
* beacon
```sql
create table beacon (
    id_beacon int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    UUID char(32) not null,
    major char(4) not null,
    minor char(4) not null,
    beacon_address char(17) not null,
    id_workplace int(11) not null
);
```

create table circumstance (
    id_circumstance int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    datetime datetime not null,
    id_workplace int(11) not null,

);
```

);
```

    id_workplace int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    name_workplace varchar(20) not null,
    location_workplace varchar(20) not null,
    coordinateX int(5) not null,
    coordinateY int(5) not null,

# Suwon Univ. 207 Lab - IoT Project

## About this repository
This repository is for the project that has been performing by 207 laboratory at Suwon University since 2015. 11.<br>
And this is supported by Hanium ICT mentoring program<br>

### Hanium project members

* Yang Deokgyu - team leader
* Lee Yootaek
* Sim Jeounghyeon
* Baek Soyoung
* Kang Eunjeoung
* Kim Seoungwang (Not in this project officially)

## What is this project?
Simply, the service of this project is to provide a solution that is associated with attendance management of the employees of any organization including any company or enterprise, school and so on<br>
With this service, the administrators can know all about attendance status of all of employees more easily<br>
Also they can show these things as visualized data<br>
Before use this service, be sure all employees have to install the Android application we made and of course, never remove that application<br>
The application detect where the user in and automatically send a commute information to server when the user is in or out of the specific places<br> 
To detect where is the specific place at Android application, each "specific" place must has 3 BLE beacons,<br>
and these beacons must be registered into the database that is used by this Node.js server<br>

### Github repository of mentioned Android application
This application has been developing by Lee Yootaek<br>
[GitHub - CommutingChecker by Lee Yootaek](https://github.com/eldbxor/CommutingChecker)<br>

## Requirement and Environment
### Needed pre-known languages and background of using frameworks in this project to development
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Skills of writing SQLs for MySQL or MariaDB
* Node.js and npm

### Used npm packages
* express.js
* node-mysql
* node-rsa
* node-schedule
* node-time
* async
* winston

### Framework to provide responsive website
* AdminLTE

### Framework to communicate between Node.js and Android devices
* socket.io

## How to execute this Node.js server
Clone this repository and install npm packages, rename default AdminLTE index page to avoid accessing wrong page. Then run as debugging mode<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesometic/207lab_iot_project.git
cd 207lab_iot_project
npm install
mv node_modules/admin-lte/index.html node_modules/admin-lte/index.html.backup
sudo DEBUG=app:* npm start
```

## Essential pre-installed database structure
You have to make database and tables into your DBMS to use this Node.js server properly<br>
```javascript
var pool = mysql.createPool({
    connectionLimit : 100,
    host            : 'localhost',
    user            : '207lab',
    password        : '207lab',
    database        : 'project_CM'
});
```
As you can see above code, you should make database named "project_CM",<br>
and add a user named '207lab' into your DBMS, give password '207lab' on it<br>
Or, you can just modify the code as you want. This code is involved in /public/libs/db.js<br>
Be sure you granted to "the user" to access "the project" through localhost<br>
This service requires database tables that is figured below<br>
* beacon
```sql
create table beacon (
    id_beacon int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    UUID char(32) not null,
    major char(4) not null,
    minor char(4) not null,
    beacon_address char(17) not null,
    id_workplace int(11) not null
);
```
* circumstance
```sql
create table circumstance (
    id_circumstance int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    datetime datetime not null,
    id_workplace int(11) not null,
    smartphone_addrss char(17) not null,
    commute_status tinyint(2) not null
);
```
* common
```sql
create table common (
    company_name varchar(20) not null,
    work_start_time time not null,
    work_end_time time not null
);
```
* department
```sql
create table department (
    id int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    name varchar(20) not null
);
```
* identity
```sql
create table identity (
    smartphone_address char(17) not null primary key,
    employee_number varchar(20) not null,
    name varchar(20) not null,
    password char(64) not null,
    id_department int(11) not null,
    id_position int(11) not null,
    permission tinyint(1) not null,
    admin tinyint(1) not null
);
```
* position
```sql
create table position (
    id int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    name varchar(20) not null,
    permission_level int(8) unsigned not null
);
```
* workplace
```sql
create table workplace (
    id_workplace int(11) not null primary key auto_increment,
    name_workplace varchar(20) not null,
    location_workplace varchar(20) not null,
    coordinateX int(5) not null,
    coordinateY int(5) not null,
    coordinateZ int(5) not null,
    thresholdX int(5) not null,
    thresholdY int(5) not null,
    thresholdZ int(5) not null,
    latitude float(10, 7) not null,
    longitude float(10, 7) not null,
    beacon_set tinyint(1) not null
);
```
After creating these tables, you have to put some data as default value into workplace, department, position tables<br>
You can insert default values like
```sql
insert into workplace values (-1, 'default', 'default', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1);
insert into department values (-1, 'default');
insert into position values (-1, 'default', 0);
insert into common values ('default', '09:00', '17:00');
```
And then, you have to add a user as administrator<br>
default ID: admin, password: admin<br>
Of course, you may change administrator's ID or password<br>
Before insert administrator user into your database, ensure you have finished the required previous step<br>
```sql
insert into identity values ('00:00:00:00:00:00', 'admin', 'admin', SHA2('admin', 256), -1, -1, 1, 1);
```
Finally, you'd better create relationships in your DBMS (use foreign key)<br>
It is not a necessary part, but to improve stability of system, it's worth it<br>
```sql
alter table circumstance add constraint FK_circumstance_workplace foreign key circumstance(id_workplace) references workplace(id_workplace);
alter table circumstance add constraint FK_circumstance_identity foreign key circumstance(smartphone_address) references identity(smartphone_address);
alter table identity add constraint FK_identity_department foreign key identity(id_department) references department(id);
alter table identity add constraint FK_identity_position foreign key identity(id_position) references project_CM.position(id);
alter table beacon add constraint FK_beacon_workplace foreign key beacon(id_workplace) references workplace(id_workplace);
```
Okay, now you can test/use our service<br>
